Hi guys!

I hope the index.html will meet all the specifications! Here are my reflections on the project:

You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your 
thoughts about web development here. 

Answer the following questions:

* What new skills have you learned?
  
I had about one year of experience writing HTML prior to this project, so it was kind of easy. However, 
I learned to use the sup element for proper referencing.

I also learned about the time element, but I am not sure I have used it appropriately.


* What has been easy?
  
Pretty much everything. Took me about 15 minutes.


* What has been difficult?
  
Nothing really.


* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I did not have used the problem solving strategies for this project. But I have used them for others, 
and will talk about it in future projects.



If you have additional questions, please let me know.

Thanks in advance for reviewing this project,

Michel
