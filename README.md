===============================

### Description
This is a Udacity's front-end nanodegree project in which we started with a plain index.html file and needed to make an exact replicate of the __blog-mockup.pdf__ file.
  
You can see the result [here](http://michelml.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-html-blog/)
